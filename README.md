# line-segment-saliency-quantification
In this work, a conceptually simple and effective algorithm is proposed to quantify the saliency of line segments, with the goal of extracting wireframes with high saliency from universal line segments. First, Sobel edge detection operator is adopted to capture the contrast of line segments. Subsequently, a metric is designed to compute the similarity between line segments so that some interfering line segments are discarded in advance. Eventually, saliency is mainly quantified by length and contrast. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work to implement the quantification of line segment saliency. Experimental results on York Urban Dataset and Wireframe Dataset validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.
